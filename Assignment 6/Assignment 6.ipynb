    "### Observations\n",
    "1. **Variability in Connection Times:** For certain stops such as between 'Gamlestads torg' and 'Ejdergatan', multiple trams serve the same route. However, the travel time varies depending on the tram. In our graph, we opted to represent this connection using the shortest possible time between the two stops. By representing connections with the shortest possible time, it's worth noting that some trams might take longer than depicted in our graph.\n",
    "2. **Standardizing Stop Names:** We noticed discrepancies in the casing of tram stop names. To avoid any duplication and ensure consistency in our data representation, all tram stop names were converted to lowercase.\n",
    "3. **Asymmetric Travel Times:** Some connections, like A->B and B->A, displayed different travel times depending on the direction. However based on the assignment description, we assumed that the travel time between A and B would be the same as the travel time between B and A. This assumption may not fully reflect real-world scenarios where traffic, tram frequency, or other factors could affect travel times however it was necessary to ensure the validity of our results.\n",
    "4. **Limitation with DAG Shortest Path Algorithm:** The DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) shortest path algorithm was unsuitable for certain paths, like from Saltholmen to Chalmers. The tram network isn't purely acyclic, especially since some routes are faster in one direction than the other. This limitation should be noted when choosing algorithms for analysis.\n",
    "5. **Final Output:** The computed travel time between 'Chalmers' and 'Centralstationen' was 10 minutes using the Dijkstra's algorithm compared to the 11 minutes using the DAG Shortest Path algorithm. In contrast, traveling from 'Saltholmen' to 'Chalmers' took 28 minutes using Dijkstra's algorithm. However, the DAG shortest path algorithm was unable to find a path between these two stops given that the tram network isn't purely acyclic.\n",

    "#### Explanation for the build_tram_network_graph() implementation\n",
    "The method begins by initializing a dictionary with key tram hubs and terminal stops paired with empty dictionaries. It then traverses each tram line, creating edges between stops. For each tram line, the method iterates over its stops. Using the assignment's guideline of 'the approximate time (in minutes) from that tram stop to the tram stop that is given on the next line of the file', it uses the current_time to determine the time between consecutive stops. This time is added as a value for both the current stop to the next and vice versa, in accordance with the assignment's provision that travel times are symmetric (i.e., 'the time between stops A and B will be the same as between B and A'). If a connection between two stops already exists, the method selects the shorter time, accounting for variable connection times. The graph is then returned.\n",

    "The DAG shortest path algorithm is designed for Directed Acyclic Graphs, but our tram network, containing cycles, isn't a DAG. The dag_shortest_path method assumes no cycles, leading to non-optimal results on cyclic graphs. Dijkstra's algorithm correctly computes the shortest path for cyclic graphs, as long as there are no negative weights. Therefore, since the tram network graph is cyclic, Dijkstra's algorithm produces the correct result.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why does the DAG shortest path algorithm not find a path between Saltholmen and Chalmers?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The DAG shortest path algorithm works best for graphs without loops or cycles. However, in the tram network, trams can travel back and forth between stops, creating potential loops. Since the tram network contains these loops, it's not suitable for the DAG algorithm, leading to the issue of not finding a path between Saltholmen and Chalmers."
