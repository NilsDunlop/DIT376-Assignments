    "### Observations\n",
    "1. **Variability in Connection Times:** For certain stops such as between 'Gamlestads torg' and 'Ejdergatan', multiple trams serve the same route. However, the travel time varies depending on the tram. In our graph, we opted to represent this connection using the shortest possible time between the two stops.\n",
    "2. **Standardizing Stop Names:** We noticed discrepancies in the casing of tram stop names. To avoid any duplication and ensure consistency in our data representation, all tram stop names were converted to lowercase.\n",
    "3. **Asymmetric Travel Times:** Some connections, like A->B and B->A, displayed different travel times depending on the direction. This meant that we could not assume bidirectional symmetry and had to account for each direction's time separately.\n",
    "4. **Unsorted Data Files:** The tram data files were not sorted in any particular order. This meant that we had to reverse the data to correctly sequence the stops.\n",
    "5. **Limitation with DAG Shortest Path Algorithm:** The DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) shortest path algorithm was unsuitable for certain paths, like from Saltholmen to Chalmers. The tram network isn't purely acyclic, especially since some routes are faster in one direction compared to the opposite. This limitation should be noted when choosing algorithms for analysis.\n",
    "6. **Final Output:** The computed travel time between 'Chalmers' and 'Centralstationen' was 4 minutes. In contrast, traveling from 'Saltholmen' to 'Chalmers' took 23 minutes."
