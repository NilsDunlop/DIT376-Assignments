In this phase, Timsort sorts small sublists, or 'runs,' using Insertion Sort, exploiting its efficiency on small or partially sorted data. After the runs are sorted, Timsort employs the merging operation within Merge sort, a stable, efficient, comparison-based, divide and conquer sorting algorithm, to merge lists. The combination of Insertion Sort and Merge Sort in Timsort allows it to effectively handle diverse data sets, optimizing for different types of data arrangements and sizes, which addresses some of the inefficiencies of using only Insertion Sort on large, unsorted data sets."

    "\n",
    "`sort1()` which implements Insertion Sort, can have varying time complexities depending on the nature of the input. Here is a breakdown:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Best Case Complexity**: O(n)\n",
    "   * The best case occurs when the input list is already sorted. In this case, each element is compared only once with the preceding elements. Since there are nn elements, the best case time complexity is O(n).\n",
    "\n",
    "   * **Best Case Scenario:**\n",
    "     * In each iteration of the main loop, the inner while loop will not execute, as the list is already sorted, resulting in a linear time complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Worst Case Complexity**: O(n²)\n",
    "   * The worst case occurs when the input list is in reverse order. Every element must be compared with every other element, leading to a time complexity of O(n²).\n",
    "\n",
    "   * **Worst Case Scenario:**\n",
    "     * In the worst case, for every element i, i comparisons and i swaps will be made, resulting in 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + (n-1) = n(n-1)/2 = O(n²) time complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Average Case Complexity** O(n²)\n",

    "To fully understand the time complexity of the hybrid algorithm Timsort, we must understand the subprocesses, insertion sort and Merge Sorts merge operation, procedure and time complexities. Given the analysis above, insertion sort has the following time complexities: best case O(n), worst case O(n²) and average case O(n²). Now we will analyze the merge operation procedure and time complexity: \n",

    "**`merge()` Procedure**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The algorithm begins by considering two base cases:\n",
    "   * **a.** If the left list is empty, return the right list immediately since there's nothing left to merge from the left side.\n",
    "   * **b.** If the right list is empty, return the left list immediately. \n",
    "2. We initialize two iterators, `i` for the left list and `j` for the right list.\n",
    "3. Iteratively, until both `i` and `j` reach the end of their respective lists:\n",
    "   * **a.** If `left[i]` is ≤ `right[j]`, add `left[i]` to the result list and increment `i`.\n",
    "   * **b.** Else, add `right[j]` to the result list and increment `j`.\n",
    "4. After the loop, if elements remain in either the `left` or `right` list, they are appended to the `result` list. Finally, the merged `result` list is returned.\n",

    "Following the merge procedure, we will now look at the of the procedure of the `sort2()` (Timsort) algorithm.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**`sort2()` Procedure**:\n",
    "1. The algorithm starts with a predefined slice size of 32. This is because insertion sort is especially efficient on smaller arrays.\n",
    "2. Iterate over the list in intervals of the slice size:\n",
    "   * a. For each slice, apply `sort1()` (insertion sort) from the starting index of the slice to the minimum of the end of the slice or the end of the list.\n",
    "   * b. This ensures that every slice of size 32 is sorted individually.\n",
    "3. Initialize `size` as the slice size. This variable will be used to control the size of the slices being merged and will double with each iteration. The goal is to merge these small slices into progressively larger sorted sections until the whole list is sorted.\n",
    "4. Repeat until the size is less than the length of the list:\n",
    "   * a. For every `start` index from 0 to the length of the list in steps of `size * 2`:\n",
    "      * i. Determine the middle and end points for the merge operation.\n",
    "      * ii. Merge the two slices using the `merge()` function.\n",
    "      * iii. Update the list with the merged slice.\n",
    "   * b. Double the size for the next iteration.\n",
    "5. The fully sorted list `L` is now ready and returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;\n",
    "Given the procedure of `sort2()`, we can now determine its time complexity: \n",
    "1. Insertion Sort on Small Slices:\n",
    "   * Each small slice of size 32 is sorted in O(32²) time in the worst case, since the worst-case time complexity of insertion sort is O(n²). However, since 32 is a constant, we can ignore constants in big O notation. Therefore, for n elements this gives a complexity of O(n).\n",
    "2. Doubling and Merging:\n",
    "   * The merging process is O(n) for each merge (as seen above). Since the slices being merged keep doubling and at each iteration half as many merges are done as the previous iteration, this process has a logarithmic number of steps (log n) relative to the length of the list. The combined complexity of this process is O(n log n).\n",
    "\n",
    "Considering both steps, the dominant factor is the merging step, and the overall time complexity of the `sort2()` algorithm is:\n",

    "* **Worst Case**: O(n log n)\n",
    "* **Average Case**: O(n log n)\n",
