In this phase, Timsort sorts small sublists, or 'runs,' using Insertion Sort, exploiting its efficiency on small or partially sorted data. After the runs are sorted, Timsort employs Merge Sort, a stable, efficient, comparison-based, divide and conquer sorting algorithm, to merge these runs. The combination of Insertion Sort and Merge Sort in Timsort allows it to effectively handle diverse data sets, optimizing for different types of data arrangements and sizes, which addresses some of the inefficiencies of using only Insertion Sort on large, unsorted data sets."
